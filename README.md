🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React 
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MySQL
APIs Used: WeatherAPI, NewsAPI

You'll need API keys for http://api.weatherapi.com/ and https://newsapi.org/
Enter those API keys into the server side before running the program. 

Run the front-end in the terminal with 'npm run dev' 
Run the server-side in the terminal with 'node index.js'

Once both of these are running, and you've entered the API keys into index.js on the server side, the website should run as intended.
